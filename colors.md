List of colors I highly reccomend using if you plan on changing:

Red: #9E1900
Orange: #B55800
Yellow: #969C00
Green: #056500
Blue/Purple: Default color, listed below.
Black: #111111

Any other color can be used, except for white.
I just choose not to do brown or any bright color as it can be visually repelling.
If you plan on doing Black on White, change the SDL color from 255, 255, 255, 255, to 0, 0, 0, 255.
You may now set the color as White.
